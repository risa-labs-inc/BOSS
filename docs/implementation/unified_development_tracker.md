## Development Focus Areas (Next 30 Days)

1. **Complete Core Components Testing**:
   - Achieve full test coverage for TaskResolver, TaskStatus, Task Models, and TaskRetryManager

2. **Begin Code Refactoring**:
   - Start with the most critical files: vector_search_resolver.py and evolver.py

3. **Implement Database and File Operations in Main Codebase**:
   - Move from examples to the main utility directory with proper implementation

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Ensure all implemented components have comprehensive docstrings and examples
