## Development Focus Areas (Next 30 Days)

1. **Continue Lighthouse Implementation**:
   - Implement the AlertManagerResolver component for centralized alert management
   - Implement the TelemetryResolver for collecting detailed system telemetry
   - Implement the PerformanceAnalyzerResolver for analyzing system performance

2. **Begin Code Refactoring**:
   - Start with the most critical files: vector_search_resolver.py and monitoring_resolver.py
   - Refactor the newly implemented components that exceed the line threshold

3. **Complete Core Components Testing**:
   - Achieve full test coverage for TaskResolver, TaskStatus, Task Models, and TaskRetryManager
   - Ensure all implementations have proper error handling and edge case testing

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Ensure all implemented components have comprehensive docstrings and examples
   - Update the development roadmap to reflect current progress
