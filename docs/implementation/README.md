# BOSS Implementation Tracking

This directory contains documentation related to the implementation of the BOSS (Business Operations System Solver) project.

## Unified Development Tracker

As of March 6, 2024, we have consolidated all development tracking into a single source of truth:

- [Unified Development Tracker](./unified_development_tracker.md): The central tracking document that accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.

This unified tracker replaces the previous multiple tracking files to ensure consistency and eliminate discrepancies.

## Automated Tracking

The unified tracker is automatically synchronized with the codebase using the [update_tracker.py](../../scripts/update_tracker.py) script. This ensures that the tracker always reflects the actual implementation state, file sizes, and refactoring needs.

To update the tracker:

```bash
python scripts/update_tracker.py
```

The script will scan the codebase, count lines in all files, determine implementation statuses, and update the unified tracker accordingly.

## Key Features of the Unified Tracker

1. **Implementation Statuses**: Each component is marked with one of four statuses:
   - 游댮 **Not Started**: Implementation has not begun
   - 游리 **In Progress**: Implementation is underway but not complete
   - 游릭 **Completed**: Implementation is complete and present in the codebase
   - 游댯 **Example Only**: Implementation exists only in examples, not in the main codebase

2. **Testing Statuses**: Each component's testing status is tracked:
   - 游댮 **Not Tested**: No tests have been written or run
   - 游리 **Partially Tested**: Some tests exist but coverage is incomplete
   - 游릭 **Fully Tested**: Comprehensive tests exist and pass

3. **File Sizes and Refactoring Needs**: Files exceeding 150 lines are flagged for refactoring, with priorities based on size.

4. **Implementation Phases**: The tracker shows progress through the six implementation phases.

5. **Focus Areas**: Clear identification of near-term development priorities.

## Legacy Trackers

The previous tracking files are maintained for historical reference:

- [implementation_plan.md](./implementation_plan.md): Original phased implementation plan
- [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md): Visual roadmap and critical path components

The [trackers](./trackers/) directory contains the original individual tracking files, but these should be considered deprecated in favor of the unified tracker.

## Keeping the Tracker Updated

1. **Automated Updates**: Run the update script weekly to maintain accuracy
2. **Manual Adjustments**: Some fields like testing status require manual updates
3. **New Components**: When adding new components, add them to the appropriate section of the unified tracker
4. **Refactoring**: When refactoring large files, update the tracker to reflect the new structure

## Contributing

When working on the BOSS project:

1. Check the unified tracker to understand component status and refactoring needs
2. Update testing statuses as you complete tests
3. Note any discrepancies between the tracker and codebase
4. Run the update script before committing changes to ensure the tracker stays current
