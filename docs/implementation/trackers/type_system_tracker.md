## Type System Improvement Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Use consistent type annotations throughout the codebase
2. **Explicitness**: Prefer explicit types over Any
3. **Documentation**: Document type constraints in docstrings
4. **Type Guards**: Use type guards for Union type narrowing
5. **Forward References**: Use string literals for forward references
6. **Generics**: Use generic types appropriately for container types
7. **Type Aliases**: Define type aliases for complex types

## Success Criteria

| Criteria | Target |
|----------|--------|
| mypy Error Count | 0 |
| Type Coverage | >95% |
| Runtime Type Errors | Reduced by 90% |
| Code Completion Accuracy | >90% |
