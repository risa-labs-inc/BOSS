# Code Refactoring Tracker

This document tracks the progress of code refactoring efforts in the BOSS framework, focusing particularly on breaking down large files (>150 lines) into more modular components.

## Refactoring Status Legend

- ðŸ”´ **Not Started**: Refactoring has not begun
- ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress**: Refactoring is underway but not complete
- ðŸŸ¢ **Completed**: Refactoring is complete

## Large Files Refactoring Status

| File | Lines | Status | Assigned To | Target Completion | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| `vector_search_resolver.py` | 1150 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-07-15 | Break into backend-specific modules |
| `evolver.py` | 784 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-07-30 | Separate evolution strategies |
| `file_operations_resolver.py` (examples) | 774 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-08-15 | Split examples by operation type |
| `standalone_language_example.py` (examples) | 656 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-08-30 | Split by language operation |
| `language_resolver.py` | 474 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-09-15 | Move each language operation to its own file |
| `health_check_resolver.py` | 473 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-09-30 | Separate monitoring from health checking |
| `database_resolver.py` (examples) | 453 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-10-15 | Split examples by database operation |
| `chained_resolvers.py` (examples) | 437 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-10-30 | Split by chain pattern |
| `mastery_executor.py` | 536 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-11-15 | Separate execution and reporting logic |
| `mastery_registry.py` | 520 | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - | 2024-11-30 | Separate storage from registry logic |

## Refactoring Approach

For each large file, we will follow this approach:

1. **Analysis**: Examine the file and identify logical breaking points
2. **Design**: Create a design for the modular structure
3. **Refactoring**: Implement the refactoring with comprehensive tests
4. **Review**: Code review and performance testing
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new structure

## Modularization Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Applicable Files |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Strategy Pattern** | Separate different algorithms/strategies into their own classes | `evolver.py`, `language_resolver.py` |
| **Backend Separation** | Separate different backend implementations | `vector_search_resolver.py` |
| **Command Pattern** | Separate different operations into command classes | `file_operations_resolver.py` |
| **Factory Separation** | Split factories from their products | `mastery_registry.py` |
| **Example Categorization** | Split examples by category or use case | All example files |

## Benefits Tracking

For each refactoring, we will track the following benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Measure of how the code is easier to maintain
2. **Testability**: Improvement in test coverage or test simplicity
3. **Readability**: Subjective measure of code readability
4. **Performance**: Any performance impacts (positive or negative)

## Refactoring Progress

| Month | Files Refactored | Total Completed | Total Remaining |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| July 2024 | - | 0 | 10 |

## Refactoring Dependencies

Some refactorings have dependencies on others:

- `language_resolver.py` refactoring should be done before `standalone_language_example.py`
- `mastery_registry.py` refactoring should be done before `mastery_executor.py`
- `vector_search_resolver.py` should be prioritized due to its size and complexity

## Refactoring Guidelines

1. Maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
2. Update all tests to reflect the new structure
3. Keep individual files under 150 lines where possible
4. Ensure comprehensive docstrings in the new files
5. Update imports throughout the codebase
