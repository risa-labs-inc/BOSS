# Testing Completion Tracker

This document tracks the status of testing efforts for BOSS components, with a particular focus on completing tests for partially tested components.

## Test Status Legend

- 游댮 **Not Started**: Testing has not begun
- 游리 **In Progress**: Testing is underway but not complete
- 游릭 **Completed**: Testing is complete and passing

## Testing Priorities

Components are prioritized based on:
1. Components on the critical path
2. Components with partial test coverage
3. Components recently implemented

## Test Coverage Goals

| Date | Target Test Coverage |
|------|---------------------|
| 2024-07-31 | 50% |
| 2024-08-15 | 70% |
| 2024-08-31 | 85% |
| 2024-09-15 | 90% |

## Common Testing Issues

| Issue | Description | Solution | Components Affected |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| Type Compatibility | Type compatibility issues with version keys | Implement custom comparison functions for version strings | TaskResolverRegistry, MasteryRegistry |
| Async Method Testing | Difficulty testing async methods properly | Use pytest-asyncio fixtures and proper mocking | HealthCheckResolver, MasteryExecutor |
| External Dependencies | Testing with external dependencies (DBs, APIs) | Use proper mocking or containerized test environments | VectorSearchResolver, DatabaseTaskResolver |
| Complex State Management | Testing components with complex internal state | Create comprehensive test fixtures covering edge cases | MasteryExecutor, MasteryComposer |

## Test Completion Checklist

Each component should go through the following testing steps:

- [ ] Unit tests for all public methods
- [ ] Integration tests with dependent components
- [ ] Error handling and edge case tests
- [ ] Performance tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation of testing approach
- [ ] CI integration
