## Documentation Coverage Goals

| Component Type | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Target Date |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Core Components | ~70% | 100% | 2024-07-31 |
| LLM Components | ~80% | 100% | 2024-08-31 |
| Utility Components | ~40% | 100% | 2024-09-30 |
| Operations Components | ~50% | 100% | 2024-10-31 |
| Advanced Components | 0% | 100% | 2024-11-30 |

## Documentation Quality Metrics

| Metric | Measurement Method | Target |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Code Coverage | % of public methods with docstrings | 100% |
| Example Coverage | % of components with examples | 100% |
| Documentation Accuracy | Manual review score (1-5) | 4.5+ |
| User Comprehension | User testing success rate | 90%+ |

## Documentation Format Standards

All documentation should follow these standards:

1. **API Documentation**:
   - Every public method must have a docstring
   - Parameters, return values, and exceptions must be documented
   - Examples should be included where appropriate

2. **Examples**:
   - Must be runnable as-is
   - Should include comments explaining key concepts
   - Should demonstrate real-world use cases
   - Should include error handling

3. **Guides**:
   - Should include a purpose statement
   - Should have step-by-step instructions
   - Should include troubleshooting sections
   - Should link to relevant API documentation
