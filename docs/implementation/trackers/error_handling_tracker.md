## Integration Points

The error handling enhancements will be integrated with:

1. **TaskRetryManager**: Enhanced retry strategies
2. **HealthCheckResolver**: Error reporting and circuit breaker state
3. **ErrorStorageResolver**: Error categorization and storage
4. **MasteryExecutor**: Handling of cascading failures
5. **TaskResolverEvolver**: Using error patterns for evolution decisions

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Error Recovery Rate | - | 95% | % of errors that auto-recover through retry |
| Cascading Failure Rate | - | <5% | % of failures that cascade to dependent systems |
| Error Categorization Accuracy | - | 90% | % of errors correctly categorized |
| Mean Time To Recovery | - | <30s | Average time to recover from transient errors |
