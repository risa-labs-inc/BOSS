## Optimization Guidelines

1. **Measure First**: Always measure before and after optimization
2. **Focus on Hot Paths**: Prioritize frequently used code paths
3. **Documentation**: Document performance characteristics
4. **No Premature Optimization**: Focus on proven bottlenecks
5. **Maintain Readability**: Don't sacrifice code clarity without significant gains

| Bottleneck | Impact | Optimization Approach | Priority |
|------------|--------|------------------------|----------|
| Vector similarity search | High latency for large vector sets | Implement HNSW indexing, caching | High |
| Database connection establishment | Latency spikes | Connection pooling, lazy connections | High |
| LLM API response handling | Processing overhead | Streamlined parsing, async processing | Medium |
| Task result serialization | Overhead for large results | Optimized serialization format | Medium |
| Health check system | High overhead during checks | Parallel checks, caching | Low |
