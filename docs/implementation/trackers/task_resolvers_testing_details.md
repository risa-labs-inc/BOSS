## Detailed Test Reports

### TaskResolver (Abstract Base Class)

**Test Date**: 2024-05-15

**Health Check Results**: Passed - Health check method properly returns boolean status and handles exceptions.

**Sample Tasks Used**:
1. Basic string input task
2. Task with complex nested input data
3. Task with invalid input

**Issues Found**: None

**Evolution History**: Initial implementation

**Retry Configuration**: N/A (handled by TaskRetryManager)

**Notes and Observations**: The abstract base class provides a solid foundation for all TaskResolvers. The default implementation of `health_check()` and `__call__()` methods ensures consistent behavior across all implementers.

### TaskRetryManager

**Test Date**: 2024-05-15

**Health Check Results**: Passed - Functions properly with all backoff strategies.

**Sample Tasks Used**:
1. Task requiring multiple retries
2. Task failing with unrecoverable errors
3. Tasks with different backoff strategies

**Issues Found**: None

**Evolution History**: Initial implementation

**Retry Configuration**:
- Default `max_retries` = 3
- Supported strategies: CONSTANT, LINEAR, EXPONENTIAL, FIBONACCI, RANDOM, JITTERED
- Default strategy: EXPONENTIAL
- Default base delay: 1 second
- Default max delay: 60 seconds
- Default jitter factor: 0.1

**Notes and Observations**: All backoff strategies function as expected. The JITTERED strategy provides good randomization to prevent synchronized retries. The implementation handles both regular functions and async functions correctly.

4. Write text file
5. Write JSON file
6. Write CSV file
7. List directory
8. Copy file
9. Move file
10. Delete file

**Issues Found**:
- Type mismatch in size_bytes assignment
- Incompatible return type for health_check()

**Fix Status**: Fixed by adding explicit typing information and updating health_check() to return boolean

**Evolution History**: Initial implementation
