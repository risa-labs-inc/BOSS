## TaskResolver Testing and Tracking

For each TaskResolver implemented during the project:

1. **Test immediately after implementation**:
   - Run the health check to verify basic functionality
   - Test with appropriate sample tasks covering normal and edge cases
   - Document any issues found during testing
   - **Create test suite for evolution verification**

2. **Fix bugs and improve**:
   - Address any issues discovered during testing
   - Implement necessary improvements or optimizations
   - Re-test to confirm fixes
   - **Verify retry mechanism functions correctly**

3. **Document test results**:
   - Update the [Implemented and Tested TaskResolvers](../../implemented_and_tested_so_far.md) document
   - Include test date, health check status, sample tasks used, issues found, and fix status
   - Add detailed notes about specific tests and issues encountered
   - Update the [TaskResolvers Tracker](../../task_resolvers_tracker.md) document to change the status to "Implemented"
   - **Document retry count and evolution thresholds**

4. **Version control**:
   - Make a git commit with a descriptive message for each TaskResolver implementation
   - Include the commit hash in the test results table
   - Use the format: `[TaskResolver] Implement and test {TaskResolver name}`

5. **Integration**:
   - Register the tested TaskResolver in the appropriate registry
   - Update dependent components as needed
   - **Configure evolution thresholds and last evolved timestamp**

This consistent testing and tracking process ensures all TaskResolvers are functioning correctly before integration into the larger system. The [TaskResolvers Tracker](../../task_resolvers_tracker.md) document provides a comprehensive overview of all planned TaskResolvers, their implementation status, and development progress.

## TaskResolver Evolution and Retry Mechanism

Each TaskResolver in the BOSS system will include:

1. **Retry Configuration**:
   - A configurable retry count that defines how many times Lanager should attempt to retry the TaskResolver on failure
   - Exponential backoff strategy for retries to avoid overwhelming resources
   - Specific error types that should or should not trigger retries

2. **Evolution Mechanisms**:
   - Tests must be created before implementing a TaskResolver to serve as evolution verification
   - "Last evolved time" timestamp to track when the TaskResolver was last evolved
   - "Threshold to evolve next" parameter defining the minimum time between evolutions
   - When errors occur and evolution threshold isn't reached, request human intervention
   - All errors are stored in Lighthouse, regardless of retry or evolution status

3. **Evolution Verification**:
   - Before accepting an evolved TaskResolver, it must pass all previously passing tests
   - The evolution process must preserve backward compatibility with existing integrations
   - Evolution history is maintained for auditing and rollback if needed

## Task Dashboard and UI Features

The BOSS web interface will include a comprehensive task dashboard:

1. **Vector-Based Search**:
   - Every task in Lighthouse will be stored with vector embeddings using PostgreSQL vector plugin
   - Advanced search capability across all task parameters and content
   - Semantic search to find tasks by description, outcome, or related concepts

2. **Task Visualization**:
   - Breadcrumb UI showing how Lanager broke down tasks into parallel and series components
   - Status indicators for each task component (pending, running, failed, completed)
   - Visual representation of task dependencies and workflows

3. **Intervention Capabilities**:
   - One-click retry functionality for failed tasks
   - Manual intervention interface for providing additional input data
   - Ability to edit input data for specific TaskResolvers
   - Option to skip certain tasks or mark them as manually completed

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Real-time status updates for all running tasks
   - Alerts for tasks requiring human intervention
   - Notifications for retry exhaustion or evolution threshold violations

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Base TaskResolver**: This is the foundation of the entire system and must be implemented first.
2. **LLM TaskResolvers**: These provide the core AI capabilities and should be implemented early.
3. **Registry System**: This enables the discovery and management of TaskResolvers and Masteries.
4. **Lanager Framework**: This orchestrates TaskResolvers to solve complex tasks.
5. **Lighthouse**: This provides the data storage and web interface for the system.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing functionality.
2. **Modular Design**: Keep components loosely coupled and highly cohesive.
3. **Documentation**: Document all code and APIs thoroughly.
4. **Performance**: Consider performance implications of all design decisions.
5. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization throughout the system.
6. **Refactoring**: Refactor code when it reaches 150 lines to maintain maintainability.
7. **Dependency Management**: Use Poetry for all dependency management.
