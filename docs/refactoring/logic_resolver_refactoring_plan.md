# LogicResolver Refactoring Plan

## Current Issues
- The `LogicResolver` class is 477 lines long, exceeding the recommended 150-line threshold
- It handles multiple responsibilities: condition evaluation, validation, branching, and combining logic
- The class contains many utility methods that could be extracted

## Proposed Refactoring

### 1. Extract Condition Functions to Separate Module

Create a new module `boss/utility/logic/conditions.py` to contain:
- `ConditionFunction` class
- All default conditions
- Helper methods like `_check_type` and `_check_pattern`

### 2. Create Operation Handler Classes

Split the operation handlers into separate classes:
- `EvaluationHandler`: Handles the "evaluate" operation
- `ValidationHandler`: Handles the "validate" operation
- `BranchingHandler`: Handles the "branch" operation
- `CombiningHandler`: Handles the "combine" operation

Each handler will have a single responsibility and can be tested independently.

### 3. Refactor LogicResolver to Use Handlers

Modify `LogicResolver` to:
- Act as a facade for the operation handlers
- Delegate operations to the appropriate handler
- Focus on task resolution and error handling

### 4. Directory Structure

```
boss/utility/logic/
├── __init__.py
├── conditions.py           # Contains ConditionFunction and default conditions
├── handlers/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── evaluation.py       # EvaluationHandler
│   ├── validation.py       # ValidationHandler
│   ├── branching.py        # BranchingHandler
│   └── combining.py        # CombiningHandler
└── logic_resolver.py       # Refactored LogicResolver
```

### 5. Implementation Plan

1. Create the new directory structure
2. Extract the `ConditionFunction` class and conditions to `conditions.py`
3. Implement each handler in its own file
4. Refactor `LogicResolver` to use the handlers
5. Update tests to ensure all functionality is preserved
6. Add new tests for the extracted components

### 6. Expected Benefits

- Improved maintainability with smaller, focused classes
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing of individual components
- More flexibility for future extensions
- Compliance with the 150-line code limit guideline
