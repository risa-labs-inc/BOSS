## Detailed Test Reports

### TaskResolver (Abstract Base Class)

**Test Date**: 2024-05-15

**Health Check Results**: Passed - Health check method properly returns boolean status and handles exceptions.

**Sample Tasks Used**:
1. Basic string input task
2. Task with complex nested input data
3. Task with invalid input

**Issues Found**: None

**Evolution History**: Initial implementation

**Retry Configuration**: N/A (handled by TaskRetryManager)

**Notes and Observations**: The abstract base class provides a solid foundation for all TaskResolvers. The default implementation of `health_check()` and `__call__()` methods ensures consistent behavior across all implementers.

### TaskRetryManager

**Test Date**: 2024-05-15

**Health Check Results**: Passed - Functions properly with all backoff strategies.

**Sample Tasks Used**:
1. Task requiring multiple retries
2. Task failing with unrecoverable errors
3. Tasks with different backoff strategies

**Issues Found**: None

**Evolution History**: Initial implementation

**Retry Configuration**:
- Default `max_retries` = 3
- Supported strategies: CONSTANT, LINEAR, EXPONENTIAL, FIBONACCI, RANDOM, JITTERED
- Default strategy: EXPONENTIAL
- Default base delay: 1 second
- Default max delay: 60 seconds
- Default jitter factor: 0.1

**Notes and Observations**: All backoff strategies function as expected. The JITTERED strategy provides good randomization to prevent synchronized retries. The implementation handles both regular functions and async functions correctly.

## Testing Framework Guidelines

### Health Check Requirements

All TaskResolvers must implement a health_check method that:
- Verifies external dependencies are accessible
- Confirms the TaskResolver can process basic input
- Returns detailed diagnostic information
- Has timeout protection
- Logs comprehensive results

### Testing Criteria by TaskResolver Type

#### LLM TaskResolvers
- API connection tests
- Response format validation
- Error handling for malformed prompts
- Timeout and retry behavior
- Token limit handling

#### Registry TaskResolvers
- Storage and retrieval accuracy
- Query performance
- Versioning functionality
- Cache invalidation
- Concurrent access handling

#### Lanager TaskResolvers
- Mastery composition validation
- Execution flow verification
- Error propagation
- Evolution threshold monitoring
- Depth-based selection accuracy

#### Context and Utility TaskResolvers
- Context retrieval accuracy
- API wrapper functionality
- Data transformation correctness
- Logic operation verification

### Evolution Testing Protocol

Before any TaskResolver can be evolved:
1. Run all existing tests to create baseline performance metrics
2. Implement evolution changes
3. Run the same tests on evolved version
4. Compare results to ensure no regression
5. Document performance improvements
6. Update evolution threshold and timestamp
