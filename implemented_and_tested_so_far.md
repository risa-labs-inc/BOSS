# Implemented and Tested TaskResolvers

This document tracks the testing results for all implemented TaskResolvers in the BOSS project. Each entry includes detailed information about testing dates, health check status, sample tasks used, issues found, and fix status.

## Test Status Legend

- ðŸ”´ **Failed**: The TaskResolver failed testing
- ðŸŸ¡ **Partial**: The TaskResolver passed some tests but failed others
- ðŸŸ¢ **Passed**: The TaskResolver passed all tests

## TaskResolvers Testing Results

## Detailed Test Reports

When a TaskResolver is tested, a detailed report should be added below including:

1. **TaskResolver Name**
2. **Test Date**
3. **Health Check Results**
4. **Sample Tasks Used**
5. **Issues Found**
6. **Evolution History**
7. **Retry Configuration**
8. **Notes and Observations**

## Testing Framework Guidelines

### Health Check Requirements

All TaskResolvers must implement a health_check method that:
- Verifies external dependencies are accessible
- Confirms the TaskResolver can process basic input
- Returns detailed diagnostic information
- Has timeout protection
- Logs comprehensive results

### Testing Criteria by TaskResolver Type

#### LLM TaskResolvers
- API connection tests
- Response format validation
- Error handling for malformed prompts
- Timeout and retry behavior
- Token limit handling

#### Registry TaskResolvers
- Storage and retrieval accuracy
- Query performance
- Versioning functionality
- Cache invalidation
- Concurrent access handling

#### Lanager TaskResolvers
- Mastery composition validation
- Execution flow verification
- Error propagation
- Evolution threshold monitoring
- Depth-based selection accuracy

#### Context and Utility TaskResolvers
- Context retrieval accuracy
- API wrapper functionality
- Data transformation correctness
- Logic operation verification

### Evolution Testing Protocol

Before any TaskResolver can be evolved:
1. Run all existing tests to create baseline performance metrics
2. Implement evolution changes
3. Run the same tests on evolved version
4. Compare results to ensure no regression
5. Document performance improvements
6. Update evolution threshold and timestamp
