# Dependency Version Tracking Rule

Always search for the latest version of a package before installing it with Poetry.

## Quick Reference

1. Check latest version: `./scripts/poetry_latest.sh check [package]`
2. Install latest version: `./scripts/poetry_latest.sh install [package]`
3. Update dependency tracker: `docs/dependency_tracker.md`
4. Run full audit: `./scripts/poetry_latest.sh audit`
