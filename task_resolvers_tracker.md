# TaskResolvers Tracker

This document tracks the implementation status of all TaskResolvers in the BOSS project. Each TaskResolver is categorized by its phase in the implementation plan and includes status, implementation date, and notes.

## Status Legend

- ðŸ”´ **Not Started**: Implementation has not begun
- ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress**: Implementation is underway
- ðŸŸ¢ **Implemented**: Implementation is complete
- âœ… **Tested**: Implementation has been tested and verified

## Implementation Critical Path

The following TaskResolvers form the critical path for initial system functionality:

1. **TaskResolver (Abstract Base Class)** - Foundation for all other components
2. **BaseLLMTaskResolver** - Enables all LLM functionality
3. **TaskResolverRegistry** - Enables discovery and management
4. **MasteryComposer** - Enables composition of workflows
5. **MasteryExecutor** - Enables execution of workflows
6. **WorklistManagerResolver** - Enables task management

## Implementation Notes

### Adding a new TaskResolver

When implementing a new TaskResolver:

1. Update this tracker with the TaskResolver name and set status to "In Progress"
2. Implement the TaskResolver according to the specifications
3. Create tests for the TaskResolver
4. Run the health check to verify functionality
5. Update this tracker with the implementation date and change status to "Implemented"
6. After testing, update the test status and add any relevant notes
7. Make a git commit with the format: `[TaskResolver] Implement and test {TaskResolver name}`

### Evolution Tracking

For each TaskResolver:

- Record the date of the last evolution in the "Last Evolution" column
- Document the evolution threshold in the "Notes" column
- Track retry counts and strategies in the "Notes" column

### Testing Requirements

All TaskResolvers must have:

- Unit tests covering normal operations
- Tests for edge cases and error handling
- A health check method that verifies basic functionality
- Evolution verification tests

### Implementation Priority Guidelines

When implementing TaskResolvers, follow these priority guidelines:

1. **Critical Path First**: Implement TaskResolvers on the critical path before others
2. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Implement lower-level TaskResolvers before those that depend on them
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure each TaskResolver is thoroughly tested before moving to dependent ones
4. **Refactor at 150 Lines**: When a TaskResolver implementation exceeds 150 lines, refactor it into smaller components
5. **Document as You Go**: Update documentation with each implementation to maintain clarity
